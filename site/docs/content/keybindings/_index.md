# Keybindings

On macOS, some bindings use Option or Fn keys instead (run `/help` for exact keybindings).

## General

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Ctrl+C` | Quit / clear input |
| `Ctrl+H` | Show keybindings |
| `Ctrl+F` | Search messages |
| `Ctrl+S` | File picker |
| `Ctrl+O` | Open plan in editor |
| `Ctrl+T` | Toggle plan panel |
| `Ctrl+M` | Model picker |

## Editing

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Enter` | Submit prompt |
| `Shift+Enter` / `Ctrl+Enter` / `Ctrl+J` / `Alt+Enter` | Newline |
| `Tab` | Toggle mode |
| `/command` | Open command palette |
| `Ctrl+W` | Delete word backward |
| `Alt+←` / `Alt+→` | Move word left / right |
| `Ctrl+A` | Jump to start of line |
| `Home` / `End` | Jump to start/end of line |
| `Ctrl+U` / `Ctrl+D` | Scroll half page up / down |
| `PageUp` / `PageDown` | Scroll page up / down |
| `Ctrl+E` | Jump to end of line |
| `Ctrl+G` | Scroll to top |
| `Ctrl+B` | Scroll to bottom |
| `Ctrl+Q` | Pop queue |
| `Esc Esc` | Rewind |
| `Alt+O` | Edit input in external editor |

### macOS-specific

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Ctrl+Del` / `⌥Del` | Delete word forward |
| `Ctrl+K` | Delete to end of line |

## While Streaming

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `↑` / `↓` | Navigate input history |
| `Esc Esc` | Cancel agent |

## Form

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `↑` / `↓` | Navigate options |
| `Enter` | Select option |
| `Esc` | Close |

## Pickers

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `↑` / `↓` | Navigate |
| `Enter` | Select |
| `Esc` | Close |
| `Type` | Filter |
| `PageUp` / `PageDown` | Scroll page up / down |
| `Ctrl+U` / `Ctrl+D` | Scroll half page up / down |

## Context-Specific

Some pickers add extra bindings on top of the defaults:

| Context | Key | Action |
|---------|-----|--------|
| Rewind Picker | `Ctrl+F` | Fork up to the selected prompt |
| Queue | `Enter` | Remove item |
| Commands | `Tab` | Complete command |
| Model Picker | `!/@/#/$` | Set tier (strong/medium/weak/compaction) |
| Session Picker | `Ctrl+N` | New session |
| Session Picker | `Ctrl+R` | Rename session |
| Session Picker | `Ctrl+D` | Delete session (press twice) |
| Thinking Picker | `↑`/`↓` | Move between effort levels |
| Thinking Picker | `0`-`9` | Type a token budget |
| Thinking Picker | `Enter` | Apply and close |
| Thinking Picker | `Esc` | Close without changing anything |

## Plugins

Built-in plugins register these themselves, and your own plugins can add more with `maki.keymap.set`:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Ctrl+P` | Browse sessions |
| `Ctrl+X` | Open tasks |
| `Alt+T` | Thinking effort |

## Context Inheritance

Child contexts inherit their parent's bindings and add their own.

- **Pickers** is the base for: Rewind Picker, Theme Picker, Model Picker, Queue, Commands, Search, File Picker

## Overriding Keybindings

Plugins and `init.lua` can rebind keys at runtime with `maki.keymap.set` and `maki.keymap.del`. The tables above are the built-in defaults. An override on the same key wins, unless a modal or overlay is open (help, plan form, permission prompt).

Precedence, high to low:

1. **Suspend** (`Ctrl+Z`, Unix). Always wins.
2. **Modal and overlay keys.** An open modal or picker consumes its keys first, so they cannot be shadowed while open.
3. **Lua overrides** from `maki.keymap.set`. The last set wins. Shadowing another plugin's binding logs a warning, and the shadowed binding returns when the plugin on top deletes it or unloads.
4. **Built-in defaults.** Any override on the same key shadows them, and the default returns once every override on it is gone. A plugin's `maki.keymap.del` only removes its own binding.

`Ctrl+C` and `Ctrl+Z` cannot be rebound, so quit and suspend always work. Only single-key bindings can be overridden. Multi-key combinations and non-key rows (like `Type` to filter) cannot.

The `/help` modal and the splash show default labels, not live overrides, but pressing the key still runs the override.

### Recovering from a bad keymap

If an override leaves Maki stuck (a modal that does not close, a plugin that throws on load), boot without user `init.lua`:

```bash
maki --no-plugins
```

Skips user `init.lua` files (global and project) but keeps the Lua host and builtin plugins running, so tools still work. Custom commands and skills still load, and the project permission rules and env file follow [folder trust](/docs/folder-trust/).

The default keymap lives in Rust, not Lua, so `--no-plugins` never drops it.

## Shell and images

These are input conventions, not remappable key rows:

- Prefix a line with `!` to run a shell command yourself (5 minute timeout). Use `!!` to hide the command and its output from the agent.
- `Ctrl+V` pastes an image from the clipboard into the prompt when the model supports vision. You can also paste image file paths.
- Middle-click inserts the PRIMARY selection, the same text middle-click pastes in a shell. Linux only, since other platforms have no PRIMARY selection. On Wayland the compositor must support it.
